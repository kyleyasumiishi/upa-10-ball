# UPA Official 10 Ball Rules

I love playing pool, and I recently joined the UPA Pool League in Seattle. We play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-ball" target="_blank">10-ball</a> in this league, which is arguably a slightly more challenging variation of 9-ball since all shots must be called and slop shots are penalized. The official rules for 8-ball, 9-ball, and 10-ball are all on the <a href="https://upatour.com/official-billiard-rules/" target="_blank">UPA website</a>, but I wanted an easily accessible, mobile-friendly 10-ball rulebook that I could reference on my iPhone in between matches. That's why I made this simple <a href="https://kyleyasumiishi.github.io/upa-10-ball/" target="_blank">10-ball rules app</a> and added it to my iPhone's Home Screen.

## About

I built this technical documentation page as one of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Projects.

freeCodeCamp is a non-profit organization that consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, Medium publications and local organizations that intend to make learning web development accessible to anyone.

## New Web Development Concepts Learned

My goal for each freeCodeCamp project is simply to learn about and practice using new web development concepts and techniques.

Here are a few new concepts I learned and practiced by building this project:

- HTML5 <code>header</code> element
- Used a CSS media query to create a responsive side navigation
- Specified the height of an object relative to the height of the viewport in CSS using the <code>vh</code> unit
- While debugging, learned about the <code>Element.getBoundingClientRect()</code> method
- CSS <code>position</code> property

## Future Work

The next step for this project is adding a searchbar so users (i.e., me) can search for keywords to quickly be directed to the relevant section.
